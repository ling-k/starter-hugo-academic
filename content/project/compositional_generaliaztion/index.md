This project 

As shown in the figure below, For traditional behavior cloning, we first collect expert demonstration data, and use it to learn a policy mapping from states to actions. However, there are some problems with this method. Expert only samples limited obersavations or, states, so the policy will make big mistakes when the agent goes to a state that has not been encountered before.
