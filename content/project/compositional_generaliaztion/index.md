We study compositional generalizaiton in world modeling, a key ability that humans possess. In particular, given scenes with some combinations of objects, if an agent has learned to interpret them as objects and their interactions, it should be able to generalize to scenes with novel combinations of objects.
We (1) formalize the compositional generalization problem with an algebraic approach and (2) study
how an agent can achieve that. We introduce (1) a synthetic and fully controllable
environment and (2) a principled empirical approach to systematically measure the
compositional generalization ability. Motivated by
the formulation, we emprically compare several methods using our environments
and design a straightforward approach, Homomorphic Object-oriented World
Model (HOWM), to study compositional generalization in dynamics prediction.

More details: To appear, will be submitted to ICLR 2022.
